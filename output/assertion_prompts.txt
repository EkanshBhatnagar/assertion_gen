1. After reset is deasserted (goes high), empty should be high on the next clock cycle.
2. After reset is deasserted (goes high), full and almost full should be low on the next clock cycle.
3. When a write is attempted (wr_en high) while the FIFO is full, the write data should not be stored in the FIFO on the next cycle.
4. When full is high and wr_en is high, overflow should be asserted high in the same cycle.
5. When a read is attempted (rd_en high) while the FIFO is empty, underflow should be asserted high in the same cycle.
6. When a successful write occurs (wr_en high and not full), the same data should appear on data_out after FIFO_DEPTH-1 successive reads, assuming no other writes occur.
7. When a successful write occurs (wr_en high and not full), wr_ack should be high on the next cycle.
8. When there is one empty entry in the FIFO, almost_full should be asserted high in the same cycle.
9. When there is only one occupied entry in the FIFO, almost_empty should be asserted high in the same cycle.
10. When a read and write are attempted simultaneously on a full FIFO, the read should succeed (data_out valid and rd_ack high) on the next cycle.
11. When a read and write are attempted simultaneously on an empty FIFO, the write should succeed (data stored and wr_ack high) on the next cycle.
