1. At most one bit of the gnt vector can be high in the same cycle.
2. For each bit i, if gnt[i] is high, then req[i] must also be high in the same cycle.
3. If any bit of req is high, then some bit of gnt must also be high in the same cycle.
4. After gnt[i] is asserted, if req[i] remains high in the next cycle, gnt[i] can only be reasserted after all other asserted bits of req have been serviced.
5. When rst_n is asserted low, gnt must be all 0s in the same cycle.
6. The gnt output must be valid in the same cycle as the req input changes, without any cycle delay.
