1. Assert that when the FIFO is not full and wr_en is asserted, the wr_ack signal is also asserted.
2. Assert that when the FIFO is full, the full signal is asserted, and any further write attempts result in the overflow signal being asserted.
3. Assert that when the FIFO is not empty and rd_en is asserted, the data_out matches the expected value based on the FIFO's internal state.
4. Assert that when the FIFO is empty, the empty signal is asserted, and any further read attempts result in the underflow signal being asserted.
5. Assert that when the FIFO has only one empty slot left, the almostfull signal is asserted.
6. Assert that when the FIFO has only one occupied slot left, the almostempty signal is asserted.
7. Assert that after a reset (rst_n asserted), all control signals (full, almostfull, empty, almostempty, overflow, underflow, wr_ack) are properly initialized to their default values.
8. Assert that when both wr_en and rd_en are asserted simultaneously, the FIFO prioritizes writing if it is empty and reading if it is full.
9. Assert that it is illegal to have both overflow and underflow asserted at the same time.
10. Assert that the data_out remains stable when rd_en is not asserted.
